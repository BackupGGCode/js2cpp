# Introduction #

JavaScript, also known as JScript, ECMAScript, and ActionScript, is an elegantly simple object-oriented programming language used today primarily to add dynamism or intelligence to web pages in the browser.  It is highly dynamic, with implicit garbage collection and no static type system, placing it in the same broad category as Perl, PHP, Python, and Ruby among many others.  It is not related to Java, but has a superficial resemblance because both languages borrow heavily from C.
