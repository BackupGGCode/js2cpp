A portable JavaScript-to-C++ compiler.  Intended to make JavaScript a viable choice for some projects that might otherwise be written in C or C++.

This is currently **very** alpha.  Only a few basic language features are implemented, and the code has only been built with MSVC 6.0 and run on Windows (Vista).  If you're interested, post or e-mail!
